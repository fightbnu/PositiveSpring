\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:conclude}
The main contribution of the present study lies in the following three aspects.
%第一，验证和拓展了以往研究的结果。不只是在主观感受上，还表现在个体的行为上
First, we validated and expanded the theoretical results of previous studies.
The characteristics of stress buffering were not only manifested in self-reported subjective feelings
but also at the behavioral level in social networks.
%理论的创新：检验了积极事件的发生与压力状态下的青少年发布微博行为、微博内容及压力变化之间的潜在关联关系，并验证了积极事件的压力缓解作用分别体现在减缓前期的压力升高和加速后期的压力降低两方面。（研究结果）
We examined the potential relationship between the occurrence of positive events and posting behaviors,
microblog contents and stress-change modes on stressed adolescents, 
and verified that positive events buffered monotonic changes in stress intensity caused by stressor events. 
%第二，本文实现了方法上的创新。本研究搭建了一个完整的技术框架，实现了1）基于微博数据自动抽取积极事件及用户行为变量，2）基于网络行为，量化当前积极事件缓解下的微博行为模式，3）建构模型实时监测青少年的压力缓解进程。
Second, this study implemented innovative methods.
Through building a complete technical framework,
we realized
1) the automatic extraction of positive events, as well as users' behaviors and content measures from microblogs 
and 2) the quantification of relationships between the stress-buffering effects of positive events and microblogging measures. 
%第三，重大现实意义：一方面实现了基于微博公开数据源，对青少年的压力缓解进程做出及时、连续监测，可用于评估青少年个体的抗压性；另一方面，可对学校和家长何时安排何种积极事件以缓解青少年压力提供辅助建议。
Third, this article showed practical significance. 
It realized the timely and continuous monitoring of the stress-buffering process of adolescents based on public social network data sources, 
which could be used to predict the change of stress and assess stress resistance in adolescents; 
It could also provide supplementary advice to schools and parents about when to schedule positive events to ease the stress of adolescents.

There were three groups of results in this work.  
Through a pilot study of scheduled exam intervals under two situations, namely, 
1) existing neighboring positive scheduled events (n=75) and 2) no neighboring positive events,
we found that students taking exams with neighboring positive events appeared to exhibit less intense stress and more stable stress fluctuations.
Students talked less about exams when positive events occurred nearby, at a lower frequency and a lower ratio. 
The results substantiated previous studies reporting the protective effect of positive events on adolescents~\citep{Cohen2010Positive,Shahar2002Positive} using laboratory methods. 
Based on this, we carried out more in-depth follow-up studies. 

The second group of results showed stress-buffering effects of positive events and monotonic changes in the stress intensity under the impact of positive events based on automatically extracted positive events (n=1,914) from the microblogs. 
A complete solution was provided for automatically detecting positive events based on microblog semantics, 
which were completely different from traditional questionnaire methods,
enabling timely, fraud-proof and continuous detection. 
The stress-buffering effects of positive events were closely correlated with adolescents’ stress-change modes, microblog linguistic expressions, and posting behaviors. 
The occurrence of positive events was verified to offset the impact of stressor events through talking about positive topics at the same time.
Adolescents tended to post more forwarded microblogs, more positive microblogs and less stressful microblogs when positive events appeared; 
however, the total frequency of microblogs did not appear to change significantly under the impact of positive events. 
This finding resonated with the study \cite{BLACHNIO2016664,Disclosure},
suggesting that users who tended to share important news on Facebook had a higher level of stress. 
The study also showed that positive events buffered monotonic changes in stress intensity caused by stressor events. 

Based on these theoretical findings, the stress-buffering patterns around positive events were further incorporated for stress prediction in adolescents. 
The predictive performance was improved compared to the baseline method when all three groups of measures, namely, stress-change modes, linguistic expressions and posting behaviors were taken into consideration. 
Stress prediction performance under different observation window lengths was also explored. 
This article proposed a novel perspective to better understand the stress-buffering process. 
Since more complex situations were simplified in the present exploration, 
the goals were still salient for stress-buffering studies from social networks. 

\section{Limitations and future work}

This study has a number of limitations.
% 1) study 1 的数据观察忽略了个人事件
First, it used a microblog dataset collected from social networks of high school students,
and chose the scheduled school events as the ground truth in the pilot study.
This method could be seen as relative fuzzy verification,
because individual events (i.e., 'lost love', or 'received a birthday present') might also have additional impact.
Therefore, the data observations in the pilot study were not 100\% rigorous and need further verification.
An improvement might be implemented by inviting participants to complete related scales
(e.g., positive and stressor scales) to label part of the dataset and achieve a balance between data volume and accuracy.

Second,
this study treated positive events as independent and studied the effect of each event separately,
which ignores the additive and collective effects of multiple positive events that might happen at the same time.
Thus, our future research might investigate the overlap effects of multiple positive events,
as well as the frequent coappearance patterns of different types of positive events to provide more accurate stress-buffering guidance for individual adolescents.
%: 1) personality, 2) social support

Based on our current research implications,
more factors could help analyze stress-buffering patterns among adolescents more comprehensively in future research.
One factor is how personality~\citep{personality1, personality2} impacts the stress-buffing effect of positive events,
which could be captured from the social media contents.
Another key factor is the role social support in social networks plays ~\citep{socialSupport2, socialSupport1}.
This factor leaves clues in the messages under each post,
and the behaviors (i.e., retweets and the number of likes) of friends.
For example,
~\citep{socialSupport1} showed that the number of Facebook friends was associated with stronger perceptions of social support,
which in turn correlated with reduced stress and greater sense of well-being.
The corresponding experimental design and the online/offline complementary verification
will be challenges in future work.
%后续结合线上线下会更准确。但是大数据量下难以执行，有效的自动标记方法需要更多的探索。
