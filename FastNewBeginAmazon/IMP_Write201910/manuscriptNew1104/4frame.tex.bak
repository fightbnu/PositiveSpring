\section{Framework}
\label{sec:frame}
We first introduce the procedure to extract positive event and its intervals from microblogs.
Based on this,
we present a statistical model to depict
the relationship between positive events and adolescents' stress-buffering patterns through three groups of content and behavioral measures.
%Finally, a none-liner time series model was proposed to combine stress-buffering patterns into future stress prediction.
\subsection{Discovery of Positive Events from Microblogs}
\label{sec:frame1}
Let $u$ = $[type,\{doer, act,$ $description\}]$ be a positive event,
where the element \emph{doer} is the subject who performs the \emph{act},
and \emph{descriptions} are the key words related to $u$.
According to psychological scales ~\citep{Jun2008Influence,hassles},
adolescent positive events mainly focus on six dimensions,
as $\mathbb{U} =\{$ 'entertainment', 'school life', 'romantic', 'pear relationship', 'self-cognition', 'family life'$\}$. We constructed our lexicon for six-dimensional positive events from two sources.
The basic positive words are selected from the psychological lexicon C-LIWC (expectation, joy, love, surprise)~\citep{Tausczik2010The}.
Then we built six topic lexicons by expanding basic positive words from adolescent microblogs,
containing 452 phrases in 'entertainment',
273 phrases in 'school life',
138 phrases in 'romantic',
91 phrases in 'peer relationship',
299 phrases in 'self-recognition' and 184 phrases in 'family life', with totally 2,606 phrases,
as examples shown in table \ref{tab:topicWords}.
Additionally, we labeled \emph{doer} words (i.e., \emph{teacher}, \emph{mother}, \emph{I, we}) in positive lexicons.

\subsubsection{Linguistic Parser Model}
Positive events were identified through Chinese natural language processing platform \citep{Che2010}.
For each post, after word segmentation, we parsed each sentence to find its linguistic structure,
and then matched the main linguistic components with positive topic lexicons in each dimension.
The linguistic parser model was applied to identify the central verb of current sentence, namely the \emph{act}.
It constructed the relationship between the central verb and corresponding \emph{doer} and \emph{description} elements.
By searching these elements in positive topic lexicons,
the existence of positive events were identified.
Due to the sparsity of posts, the element \emph{act} might be empty.
\emph{Descriptions} were collected by searching all nouns, adjectives and adverbs.
Examples of positive events extracted from adolescents' microblogs are listed in table \ref{tab:uplifts}.
For the post 'Thanks all my dear friends hosting the party. Happiest birthday!!!',
it was processed as \emph{doer='friends', act = 'expecting', description = 'party'},
and \emph{type = 'entertainment'}.

\subsubsection{Impact Intervals of Positive Events}
\label{subsec:interval}
We followed and extended ~\citep{Li2017Analyzing} to identify the impact interval of each positive event to further study its stress-buffering pattern.
The target interval was identified in three steps.

Step1:
Extracted positive events, stressor events and filtered out candidate intervals.
For each candidate interval,
we set its length to more than 3 days and a maximum gap of 1 day between two neighboured stressed days.
Since the stress series detected from microblogs were discrete points,
locally weighted regression ~\citep{Cleveland1988Locally} method was adopted to highlight characteristics of the stress curve.

Step2: Judged stressful intervals through hypothesis testing.
A Poisson based probability model was adopted to measure how confidently the current interval was a stressful interval.
Here the stressful posting rates under stress $\lambda_1$ and normal conditions $\lambda_0$ were modeled as two independent poisson process:
\begin{equation}
Pr[N=n|\lambda_i]=\frac{e^{-\lambda_i T}{(\lambda_i T)}^n}{n!}
\end{equation}
where $i\in\{0,1\}$, $n=0,1,\cdots,\infty$.
We expected that $\lambda_1 > \lambda_0$, and measured the probability as $P(\lambda_1>\lambda_0|N_1, T_1, N_0, T_0)$,
where $N_1, N_0$ are the number of stressful posts, and $T_1, T_0$ are time duration corresponding to $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_0$.
Without loss of generality, we assume a Jeffreys non-informative prior on $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_0$,
and inferred the posterior distribution $P(\lambda_1|N_1)$ and $P(\lambda_0|N_0)$ according to Bayes Rule.
Thus for current interval $I_1$ and historical normal interval $I_0$,
the quantified probability $\beta = P(\lambda_1>\lambda_0|I_1,I_0)$ $\in (0,1)$ indicated the confidence
whether $I_1$ was a stressful interval.

Step 3: Divided stressful intervals into SI set and U-SI set.
For a detected stressful interval $I = <t_1,\cdots,t_n>$, we considered the temporal order between $I$ and any detected positive event $u$ happening at time point $t_u$ in three cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item[1)] If the positive event $u$ happened during the stressful interval, i.e., $t_u \in [t_1,t_n]$, the positive interval $I$ was judged as $I \in U-SI$.
\vspace{-0.3cm}
\item[2)] If the positive event happened nearby a stressful interval,
considering the probability that it conducted impact on current stressful interval.
Here the gap between $t_u$ and $I$ is limited to $\xi$, i.e.,
if $t_u \in [t_{1}-\xi, t_1)\cup(t_{n},t_{n}+\xi]$, then $I \in U-SI$.
If a stressful interval satisfies none of the above conditions, we classify it into the SI set.
\vspace{-0.3cm}
\item[3)] Other stressful intervals were divided into U-SI set.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hypothesis Test for the Relationship between Positive Events and Adolescents' Stress-buffering}
\label{sec:frame2}
We formulated the relationship between positive events and adolescents' stress-buffering patterns
as a comparison problem between two sets of stressful intervals: the SI set and the U-SI set.
Each interval was modeled as a multi-dimensional vector depicted microblogging characteristics of current adolescent.
Specifically, the multivariate two-sample hypothesis testing method
\cite{Li2017Correlating,Johnson2012Applied} was adopted to model such relationship.
The basic idea was judging whether the multi-dimension points (i.e., stressful intervals)
in set SI and set U-SI were under different statistical distributions.
Assuming the data points in SI and U-SI were randomly sampled from distribution $F$ and $G$, respectively,
then the hypothesis was denoted as:
\begin{equation}
H_0: F = G \quad versus \quad H_1: F \neq G.
\end{equation}
Under such hypothesis,
$H_0$ indicated points in SI and U-SI were under similar distribution,
while $H_1$ meant points in SI and U-SI were under statistically different distributions,
namely positive events conducted obvious stress-buffering effect.

\subsubsection{Statistical Model of Stress-buffering Effect}
\begin{figure*}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/gray/stress.eps}
\caption{\small{Comparing stress change modes during stressful intervals in two situations:
1) intervals affected by neighboring positive events (U-SI), 2) no positive events occurred nearby (SI).
$P_{1-6}$=\{academic, romantic, peer relationship, self-cognition, family life, entertainment\},
$E_{1-5}$=\{academic, romantic, peer relationship, self-cognition, family life\}.}}
\label{fig:stress}
\end{figure*}
We took the K-Nearest Neighbor based method (\cite{Schilling1986Multivariate}) to judge the existence of significant difference between set SI and set U-SI.
For simplify, we used the symbol $A_1$ to represent set SI,
and $A_2$ represent set U-SI.
For each point $\ell_{x}$ in the two sets,
we expected its top-k similar points belonging to the same set of $\ell_x$.
The Euclidean distance was adopted to calculate the distance of structured points here.
For each point $\ell x \in A=A_1\bigcup A_2$,
let $\textbf{D}^y$ be the feature vector of $\ell_x$,
and $NN_r(\ell_x,A)$ be the function to find the $r-$th nearest neighbor of $\ell_x$.
The $r$-th nearest neighbor of $\ell_x$ was denoted as:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
& NN_r(\ell_x,A) = \{y | min\{||\textbf{D}^x-\textbf{D}^y ||_2\}, y\in(A/\ell_x)\} &
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Let $I_r(\ell_x,A1,A2)$ be the function denoting whether the $r$-th nearest neighbor was in the same set with $\ell_x$:
\begin{equation}
I_r(\ell_x,A_1,A_2) =
\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
1, \quad if \ell_x \in A_i  \&\& NN_r(\ell_x,A)\in A_i,\\
0, \quad otherwise
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
Let $T_{r,n}$ denote the proportion that pairs containing two points from the same set among all pairs formed by $\ell_x \in A$ and its $k$ nearest neighbors:
\begin{equation}
T_{k,n}= \frac{1}{n\times k}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{k}I_j(x,A_1,A_2)
\end{equation}
The value of $T_{k,n}$ showed how differently the points in the two testing sets (SI and U-SI) performed.
If the value of $T_{r,n}$ was close to $1$,
it could be shown that the two underlying distributions $F$ and $G$ for $SI$ and U-SI were significantly different,
indicating current positive events conducted obvious stress-buffering impact on the teens' stress series.
Let $\lambda_1=|A_1|$ and $\lambda_2=|A_2|$, the statistic value $Z$ was denoted as:
\begin{align}
&Z=(nr)^{1/2}(T_{r,n}-\mu_{r})/\sigma_{r}\\
&\mu_r=(\lambda_1)^2+(\lambda_2)^2\\
&{\sigma_r}^2=\lambda_1\lambda_2+4{\lambda_1}^2{\lambda_2}^2
\end{align}
where $\mu_r$ was the expectation and ${\sigma_r}^2$ was the variance of $Z$.
Based on hypothesis test theory (\cite{Johnson2012Applied}),
when the size of the testing set was large enough,
$Z$ obeyed a standard Gaussian distribution.
Thus we judged whether the positive events conducted significant stress buffering impact as follows:
if $f(SI,USI)=(nr)^{1/2}(T_{r,n}-\mu_{r})/{\mu_r}^2>\alpha$ ($\alpha = 1.96$ for $P=0.025$),
then the hypothesis $H_1$ was true.

In section \ref{subsubM},
three groups of mircoblogging measures
were introduced to depict multi-dimension characteristics of each stressful interval $\ell_x$ $\in A$,
indicated as linguistic expression matrix \bm{${D_l^x}$}, posting behavior matrix \bm{${D_p^x}$}
and stress change mode matrix \bm{${D_s^x}$}.
Correspondingly, three sub-functions of $NN_r(.)$ were defined as $PNN_r(.)$, $SNN_r(.)$ and $LNN_r(.)$.
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
& PNN_r(\ell_x,A)
= \{y | min\{||\textbf{D}_p^x-\textbf{D}_p^y ||_2\}, y\in(A/\ell_x)\} &\\
& SNN_r(\ell_x,A)
= \{z | min\{||\textbf{D}_s^x-\textbf{D}_s^z ||_2\}, z\in(A/\ell_x)\} \\
& LNN_r(\ell_x,A)
= \{w | min\{||\textbf{D}_l^x-\textbf{D}_l^w ||_2\}, w\in(A/\ell_x)\} &
 \end{aligned}
 \end{equation}
The $r$-th nearest neighbor was re-calculated as:
\begin{align}
&NN_r(\ell_x,A) = \{v | min\{a \times ||\textbf{D}_p^x-\textbf{D}_p^v||_2+\\
&b \times ||\textbf{D}_s^x-\textbf{D}_s^v||_2+
c \times ||\textbf{D}_l^x-\textbf{D}_l^v||_2\}, v\in(A/\ell_x) \}
\end{align}
In this study, we set $a = b = c = 1/3$.


\subsubsection{Measures}
\label{subsubM}
\paragraph{\textbf{Stress change modes}}
Inspired by the pilot study,
four measures were adopted to quantify the intensity of stress changes during a stressful interval:
average value of stress, accumulated value of stress, RMS value of stress, and maximal value of stress.
For an interval $I=<t_1,t_2,\cdots,t_n>$ with length $|I|=n$ (day),
the stress series was denoted as $S=<s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_n>$,
where $s_i \in S$ was the average stress value of microblogs posted in day $i$.
The four measures were denoted as
$V_{accumulate}(I)= \sum_{i=1}^{n}(s_i), V_{average}(I)= \frac{1}{n}V_{accumulated}(I)$,
$V_{RMS}(I) = \sqrt[2]{ \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(s_i)^2}}$,
$V_{maximal}(I) = max(I) = \{s_i |\forall s_j \in I \& j \neq i, s_i \geq s_j\}$.
Similarly,
we applied the four measures into positive emotion fluctuations during an interval,
which might reflect the complementary changes to stress.
To show the occurrence of above mentioned measures,
we present a 7$\times$5 gray-scale map for each measure in Figure \ref{fig:stress}.
The x-axis (ranging from P1 to P6) represent each dimension of positive events
($P$=\{academic, romantic, peer relationship, self-cognition, family life, entertainment\}),
and the last column represent no positive event happening in the observation interval.
The y-axis (ranging from S1 to S5) represent each dimension of stressor events
($E$=\{academic, romantic, peer relationship, self-cognition, family life\}).
The color of each point in a gray-scale map depended on the average value of current measure
over the corresponding set of intervals.
For a set of intervals $\textbf{I}_{<e,p>} = <I_1,I_2,\cdots,I_m>$,
where the stress was caused by stressor events $e \in E$
and impacted by positive events $p \in P$,
the measures were presented by:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
& V_{accumulated}(\textbf{I}_{<e,p>})=\sum_{i=1}^m{V_{accumulated}I_i}&\\
& V_{average}(\textbf{I}_{<e,p>})=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m\I_i&\\
& V_{RMS}(\textbf{I}_{<e,p>})=\sqrt{\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^mI_i^2}&\\
& V_{maximal}(\textbf{I}_{<e,p>}) = \{max(V_{maximal}(I_i))|i\in[1,m]\} &
 \end{aligned}
 \end{equation}
For example, in figure \ref{fig:stress} (a),
point (P4,S1) was the value of average stress in all $\textbf{I}_{<1,4>}$ intervals,
where stress was caused mainly by academic events (S1) and impacted by positive events related to self-cognition (P4).
Figure \ref{fig:stress} exhibited four stress change modes (subgraph (a) to (d))
and four corresponding positive emotion change modes (subgraph (e) to (h)) in both SI and U-SI sets.
Statistical results showed that the occurrence of positive events significantly
reduced accumulated stress (subgraph (a)), accumulated stress (subgraph (b)) and maximal stress (subgraph (d)),
and slowed down fluctuations (subgraph (c)) during stressful intervals.
On the other hand,
occurrence of positive events caused obvious increase of all positive change modes (subgraph (e) to (h)),
especially in stressful intervals caused by romantic and self-cognition events.
The above statistics on stress and positive intensity change modes
initially reflected stress-buffering effects of different types of positive events on each dimension of stressor events.

\label{fig:stopic}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{\textbf{Linguistic expressions}}
For each microblog, we identified its linguistic expressions
applying the segmentation model and parser model in section \ref{sec:frame1}.
The first measure was the frequency of stressful emotional words based on four categories (anger, anxiety, hate, sad) of LICW lexicons, represented general stress during a interval ~\citep{Tausczik2010The}.
The second measure was the frequency of positive emotional words,
which were identified based on surprise, joy, expectation and love categories of LICW lexicons.
The third measure was the frequency of topic words in five dimensions of stressor events,
representing the degree of attention for each dimension of stressor events.
Figure \ref{fig:topicAll} (a) and (b) showed the frequency of stressful emotional words and positive emotional words, respectively.
Generally, positive events showed stress-buffering effects in these two measures,
since the last column in subgraph (a) and (b) was different compared to column P1 to P6.
Specifically, positive events from romantic, peer relationship and family life showed obvious
reduction in stressful emotional words caused by
peer relationship and family life stressor events (subgraph \ref{fig:topicAll} (a)).
Figure \ref{fig:stopic} showed the distribution of stressful topic words when different positive events occurred.
Here we showed the statistical results during stressful intervals caused by academic and self-cognition stressor events.
The frequency of academic stress topic words (subgraph (a1) and (b1))
and academic positive topic words (subgraph (a2) and (b2)) showed not clear regular.
Further we explored the offset result for each dimension of stressful and positive topic words,
as shown in subgraph (a3) and (b3).
The offset results showed obvious stress-buffering results,
since stressful topic words showed decrease in column P1 to P5 in subgraph (a3),
and positive topic words exhibited increase in column P1 to P5 in subgraph (b3).
These revealed that the occurrence of positive events offset the impact of stressor events through talking about positive topics at the same time.

\label{fig:post}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{\textbf{Posting behaviors}}
Stress could lead to abnormal posting behaviors,
reflecting user's changes in social engagement activity ~\citep{Liang2015Teenagers}.
We considered four measures of posting behaviors here.
The first measure was frequency of stressful microblogs,
highlighting stressful microblogs among all microblogs.
Research in \cite{Li2017Analyzing} indicated that overwhelmed adolescents
tended to post more microblogs expressing their stress for releasing and seeking comfort from friends.
The second measure was frequency of positive microblogs,
indicating the number of positive microblogs per day.
The third measure was the total number of all microblogs per day.
The forth measure was frequency of forwarded microblogs,
showing the number of re-tweet and shared microblogs.
Figure \ref{fig:post} summarized the distribution of above four measures in U-SI and SI sets.
Results in subgraph (a) and (b) showed decrease of stressful microblogs and
increase of positive microblogs when positive events occurred.
Subgraph (d) indicated adolescents tended to forward more microblogs when positive events happened,
while subgraph (c) showed that the frequency of all microblogs didn't appear obvious change under the impact of positive events.

\subsubsection{Monotonous Model of Stress-buffering}
\label{sec:mono}
To further verify the monotonous changes of stress intensity under the impact of positive events,
for each stressful interval in SI (n=2,582) and U-SI (n=1,914) sets,
we compared its stress intensity with the front and rear adjacent intervals respectively.
For a stressful interval $I = <t_i,t_{i+1},\cdots,t_j>$,
let $I^{front} = <t_m,\cdots,t_{i-1}>$ be the adjacent interval before $I$,
and $I^{rear} = <t_{j+1},\cdots,t_n>$ be the rear adjacent interval of $I$.
The length of $I^{front}$ and $I^{rear}$ were set to $|I|$.
For the set of stressful intervals $SI$ composed of $<I_1,I_2,\cdots,I_N>$,
the corresponding sets of adjacent front and rear intervals were denoted as $SI^{front}$ and $SI^{rear}$.
Similarly, for the set of stressful intervals $USI$ = $<UI_1,UI_2,\cdots, UI_M>$ impacted by positive events,
the corresponding sets of adjacent front intervals and adjacent rear intervals were denoted as $USI^{front}$ and $USI^{rear}$.
We compared the intensity of stress changes in following four situations,
where $g(.)$ was the function comparing two sets: \\
1) $g(SI,SI^{front}$) returned if intensive change happened when stressful intervals begin.\\
2) $g(SI,SI^{rear}$) returned if stress changes intensively after the stressful intervals end.\\
3) $g(USI,USI^{front}$) returns if intensive change happened when stressful intervals affected by positive events.\\
4) $g(USI,USI^{rear}$) returns if stress changed intensively after stressful intervals affected by positive events.

In our problem, taking the comparison between $SI$ and $SI^{rear}$ for example,
the basic computation element $I_k \in SI \cup SI^{rear}$ in both sets was an interval, denoted as a multi-dimension point.
Here we adopt the t-test method as the intensity computation function $g(.)$.
The function $g(.) = t_{score}$ $\in$ (-1,1) was represented as:

\begin{equation}
\small{g(SI,SI^{rear})}= \frac{\mu_{SI}-\mu_{SI^{rear}}}{\sqrt{\frac{(n_1-1)\sigma^2_{SI}+(n_2-1)\sigma^2_{SI^{rear}}}{n_1+n_2-2}(\frac{1}{n_1}-\frac{1}{n_2})}}
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{SI}$ and $\mu_{SI^{rear}}$ were the mean stress values of intervals in sets $SI$ and $SI^{rear}$,
and $\sigma_{SI}$ and $\sigma_{SI^{rear}}$ were the variance stress values of intervals in sets $SI$ and $SI^{rear}$, respectively.
If $g(SI,SI^{rear})$ $> \alpha$, stress intensity in $SI^{rear}$ showed significant decrease compared with $SI$ (monotonic negative effect).
If $g(SI^{front},SI)$ $< -\alpha$, stress intensity in $SI$ showed significant increase compared with $SI^{front}$ (monotonic positive effect).
Here we adopted $\alpha$ = 1.96, $P$ = 0.025.
We conducted comparison for above four situations
to observe whether the occurrence of positive events relieved the monotonic negative effect of $g(SI,SI^{rear})$
and the monotonic positive effect of $g(SI^{front},SI)$.
