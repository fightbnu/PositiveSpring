\section{Framework}
We first introduce the procedure to extract positive event and its intervals from microblogs.
Based on this,
we present a statistical model to depict
the relationship between positive events and adolescents' stress-buffering patterns through three groups of content and behavioral measures.
%Finally, a none-liner time series model was proposed to combine stress-buffering patterns into future stress prediction.
\subsection{Discovery of Positive Events from Microblogs}
\label{sec:frame1}
Let $u$ = $[type,\{doer, act,$ $description\}]$ be a positive event,
where the element \emph{doer} is the subject who performs the \emph{act},
and \emph{descriptions} are the key words related to $u$.
According to psychological scales ~\citep{Jun2008Influence,hassles},
adolescent positive events mainly focus on six dimensions,
as $\mathbb{U} =\{$ 'entertainment', 'school life', 'romantic', 'pear relationship', 'self-cognition', 'family life'$\}$. We constructed our lexicon for six-dimensional positive events from two sources.
The basic positive words are selected from the psychological lexicon C-LIWC (expectation, joy, love, surprise)~\citep{Tausczik2010The}.
Then we built six topic lexicons by expanding basic positive words from adolescent microblogs,
containing 452 phrases in 'entertainment',
273 phrases in 'school life',
138 phrases in 'romantic',
91 phrases in 'peer relationship',
299 phrases in 'self-recognition' and 184 phrases in 'family life', with totally 2,606 phrases,
as examples shown in table \ref{tab:topicWords}.
Additionally, we labeled \emph{doer} words (i.e., \emph{teacher}, \emph{mother}, \emph{I, we}) in positive lexicons.

\begin{table*}

\end{tabular}}
\end{table*}

\subsubsection{Linguistic Parser Model}
Positive events were identified through Chinese natural language processing platform \citep{Che2010}.
For each post, after word segmentation, we parsed each sentence to find its linguistic structure,
and then matched the main linguistic components with positive topic lexicons in each dimension.
The linguistic parser model was applied to identify the central verb of current sentence, namely the \emph{act}.
It constructed the relationship between the central verb and corresponding \emph{doer} and \emph{description} elements.
By searching these elements in positive topic lexicons,
the existence of positive events were identified.
Due to the sparsity of posts, the element \emph{act} might be empty.
\emph{Descriptions} were collected by searching all nouns, adjectives and adverbs.
Examples of positive events extracted from adolescents' microblogs are listed in table \ref{tab:uplifts}.
For the post 'Thanks all my dear friends hosting the party. Happiest birthday!!!',
it was processed as \emph{doer='friends', act = 'expecting', description = 'party'},
and \emph{type = 'entertainment'}.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\caption{\small{Extracted positive events from microblogs.}}

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline

\end{center}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Impact Intervals of Positive Events}
\label{subsec:interval}
We followed and extended ~\citep{Li2017Analyzing} to identify the impact interval of each positive event to further study its stress-buffering pattern.
The target interval was identified in three steps.

Step1:
Extracted positive events, stressor events and filtered out candidate intervals.
For each candidate interval,
we set its length to more than 3 days and a maximum gap of 1 day between two neighboured stressed days.
Since the stress series detected from microblogs were discrete points,
locally weighted regression ~\citep{Cleveland1988Locally} method was adopted to highlight characteristics of the stress curve.

Step2: Judged stressful intervals through hypothesis testing.
A Poisson based probability model was adopted to measure how confidently the current interval was a stressful interval.
Here the stressful posting rates under stress $\lambda_1$ and normal conditions $\lambda_0$ were modeled as two independent poisson process:
\begin{equation}
Pr[N=n|\lambda_i]=\frac{e^{-\lambda_i T}{(\lambda_i T)}^n}{n!}
\end{equation}
where $i\in\{0,1\}$, $n=0,1,\cdots,\infty$.
We expected that $\lambda_1 > \lambda_0$, and measured the probability as $P(\lambda_1>\lambda_0|N_1, T_1, N_0, T_0)$,
where $N_1, N_0$ are the number of stressful posts, and $T_1, T_0$ are time duration corresponding to $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_0$.
Without loss of generality, we assume a Jeffreys non-informative prior on $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_0$,
and inferred the posterior distribution $P(\lambda_1|N_1)$ and $P(\lambda_0|N_0)$ according to Bayes Rule.
Thus for current interval $I_1$ and historical normal interval $I_0$,
the quantified probability $\beta = P(\lambda_1>\lambda_0|I_1,I_0)$ $\in (0,1)$ indicated the confidence
whether $I_1$ was a stressful interval.

Step 3: Divided stressful intervals into SI set and U-SI set.
For a detected stressful interval $I = <t_1,\cdots,t_n>$, we considered the temporal order between $I$ and any detected positive event $u$ happening at time point $t_u$ in three cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item[1)] If the positive event $u$ happened during the stressful interval, i.e., $t_u \in [t_1,t_n]$, the positive interval $I$ was judged as $I \in U-SI$.
\vspace{-0.3cm}
\item[2)] If the positive event happened nearby a stressful interval,
considering the probability that it conducted impact on current stressful interval.
Here the gap between $t_u$ and $I$ is limited to $\xi$, i.e.,
if $t_u \in [t_{1}-\xi, t_1)\cup(t_{n},t_{n}+\xi]$, then $I \in U-SI$.
If a stressful interval satisfies none of the above conditions, we classify it into the SI set.
\vspace{-0.3cm}
\item[3)] Other stressful intervals were divided into U-SI set.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hypothesis Test for the Relationship between Positive Events and Adolescents' Stress-buffering}
\label{sec:frame2}
We formulated the relationship between positive events and adolescents' stress-buffering patterns
as a comparison problem between two sets of stressful intervals: the SI set and the U-SI set.
Each interval was modeled as a multi-dimensional vector depicted microblogging characteristics of current adolescent.
Specifically, the multivariate two-sample hypothesis testing method
\cite{Li2017Correlating,Johnson2012Applied} was adopted to model such relationship.
The basic idea was judging whether the multi-dimension points (i.e., stressful intervals)
in set SI and set U-SI were under different statistical distributions.
Assuming the data points in SI and U-SI were randomly sampled from distribution $F$ and $G$, respectively,
then the hypothesis was denoted as:
\begin{equation}
H_0: F = G \quad versus \quad H_1: F \neq G.
\end{equation}
Under such hypothesis,
$H_0$ indicated points in SI and U-SI were under similar distribution,
while $H_1$ meant points in SI and U-SI were under statistically different distributions,
namely positive events conducted obvious stress-buffering effect.

\subsubsection{Statistical Model of Stress-buffering Effect}
We took the K-Nearest Neighbor based method (\cite{Schilling1986Multivariate}) to judge the existence of significant difference between set SI and set U-SI.
For simplify, we used the symbol $A_1$ to represent set SI,
and $A_2$ represent set U-SI.
For each point $\ell_{x}$ in the two sets,
we expected its top-k similar points belonging to the same set of $\ell_x$.
The Euclidean distance was adopted to calculate the distance of structured points here.
For each point $\ell x \in A=A_1\bigcup A_2$,
let $\textbf{D}^y$ be the feature vector of $\ell_x$,
and $NN_r(\ell_x,A)$ be the function to find the $r-$th nearest neighbor of $\ell_x$.
The $r$-th nearest neighbor of $\ell_x$ was denoted as:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
& NN_r(\ell_x,A) = \{y | min\{||\textbf{D}^x-\textbf{D}^y ||_2\}, y\in(A/\ell_x)\} &
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Let $I_r(\ell_x,A1,A2)$ be the function denoting whether the $r$-th nearest neighbor was in the same set with $\ell_x$:
\begin{equation}
I_r(\ell_x,A_1,A_2) =
\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
1, \quad if \ell_x \in A_i  \&\& NN_r(\ell_x,A)\in A_i,\\
0, \quad otherwise
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
Let $T_{r,n}$ denote the proportion that pairs containing two points from the same set among all pairs formed by $\ell_x \in A$ and its $k$ nearest neighbors:
\begin{equation}
T_{k,n}= \frac{1}{n\times k}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{k}I_j(x,A_1,A_2)
\end{equation}
The value of $T_{k,n}$ showed how differently the points in the two testing sets (SI and U-SI) performed.
If the value of $T_{r,n}$ was close to $1$,
it could be shown that the two underlying distributions $F$ and $G$ for $SI$ and U-SI were significantly different,
indicating current positive events conducted obvious stress-buffering impact on the teens' stress series.
Let $\lambda_1=|A_1|$ and $\lambda_2=|A_2|$, the statistic value $Z$ was denoted as:
\begin{align}
&Z=(nr)^{1/2}(T_{r,n}-\mu_{r})/\sigma_{r}\\
&\mu_r=(\lambda_1)^2+(\lambda_2)^2\\
&{\sigma_r}^2=\lambda_1\lambda_2+4{\lambda_1}^2{\lambda_2}^2
\end{align}
where $\mu_r$ was the expectation and ${\sigma_r}^2$ was the variance of $Z$.
Based on hypothesis test theory (\cite{Johnson2012Applied}),
when the size of the testing set was large enough,
$Z$ obeyed a standard Gaussian distribution.
Thus we judged whether the positive events conducted significant stress buffering impact as follows:
if $f(SI,USI)=(nr)^{1/2}(T_{r,n}-\mu_{r})/{\mu_r}^2>\alpha$ ($\alpha = 1.96$ for $P=0.025$),
then the hypothesis $H_1$ was true.

In section \ref{subsubM},
three groups of mircoblogging measures
were introduced to depict multi-dimension characteristics of each stressful interval $\ell_x$ $\in A$,
indicated as linguistic expression matrix \bm{${D_l^x}$}, posting behavior matrix \bm{${D_p^x}$}
and stress change mode matrix \bm{${D_s^x}$}.
Correspondingly, three sub-functions of $NN_r(.)$ were defined as $PNN_r(.)$, $SNN_r(.)$ and $LNN_r(.)$.
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
& PNN_r(\ell_x,A)
= \{y | min\{||\textbf{D}_p^x-\textbf{D}_p^y ||_2\}, y\in(A/\ell_x)\} &\\
& SNN_r(\ell_x,A)
= \{z | min\{||\textbf{D}_s^x-\textbf{D}_s^z ||_2\}, z\in(A/\ell_x)\} \\
& LNN_r(\ell_x,A)
= \{w | min\{||\textbf{D}_l^x-\textbf{D}_l^w ||_2\}, w\in(A/\ell_x)\} &
 \end{aligned}
 \end{equation}
The $r$-th nearest neighbor was re-calculated as:
\begin{align}
&NN_r(\ell_x,A) = \{v | min\{a \times ||\textbf{D}_p^x-\textbf{D}_p^v||_2+\\
&b \times ||\textbf{D}_s^x-\textbf{D}_s^v||_2+
c \times ||\textbf{D}_l^x-\textbf{D}_l^v||_2\}, v\in(A/\ell_x) \}
\end{align}
In this study, we set $a = b = c = 1/3$.

\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Measures}
\label{subsubM}
\paragraph{\textbf{Stress and positive emotion change modes}}
Inspired by the pilot study,
to quantify the intensity of stress changes during a stressful interval,
4 measures were adopted:
average value of stress, accumulated value of stress, RMS value of stress, and maximal value of stress.
For interval $I=<t_1,t_2,\cdots,t_n>$, $|I|=n$ (day),
its stress series was denoted as $S=<s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_n>$,
where $s_i \in S$ was the average stress value of microblogs posted in day $i$.
The four measures were denoted as
$V_{accumulate}(I)= \sum_{i=1}^{n}(s_i), V_{average}(I)= \frac{1}{n}V_{accumulated}(I)$,
$V_{RMS}(I) = \sqrt[2]{ \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(s_i)^2}}$,
$V_{maximal}(I) = \{s_i |\forall s_j \in I \& j \neq i, s_i \geq s_j\}$.
Similarly,
we applied the 4 measures into the positive emotion fluctuations,
which might reflect the complementary changes to stress. %here to split
To show the occurrence of above mentioned measures,
we present a 7$\times$5 gray-scale map for each measure.
The x-axis (ranging from P1 to P6) represent each dimension of positive event
($P$={academic, romantic, peer relationship, self-cognition, family life, entertainment}),
and the 7th column represent no positive event happened in the observation interval.
The y-axis (ranging from S1 to S5) represent each dimension of stressor event
($E$={academic, romantic, peer relationship, self-cognition, family life}).
The color of each point in gray-scale map depended on the average value of current measure
over the corresponding set of intervals.
For set of intervals $\textbf{I}_{<e,p>} = <I_1,I_2,\cdots,I_m>$,
where the stress was caused by stressor events $e \in E$ 
and impacted by positive events $p \in P$, 
above measures were presented by:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
& V_{accumulated}(\textbf{I}_{<e,p>})=\sum_{i=1}^m{V_{accumulated}I_i}&\\
& V_{average}(\textbf{I}_{<e,p>})=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m\I_i&\\
& V_{RMS}(\textbf{I}_{<e,p>})=\sqrt{\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^mI_i^2}&\\
& V_{maximal}(\textbf{I}_{<e,p>}) = {max(V_{maximal}(I_i))|i\in[1,m]} &
 \end{aligned}
 \end{equation}
For example, in figure \ref{fig:stress} a),
point (P4,S1) was the value of average stress in all $\textbf{I}_{<1,4>}$ intervals,
where stress was caused mainly by academic events (S1) and impacted by positive events related to self-cognition (P4).
Figure \ref{fig:stress} exhibited 8 stress change modes (subgraph a) to d)) and positive emotion change modes (subgraph e) to h)) in both SI and U-SI sets.
Statistical results showed that the occurrence of positive events significantly reduced accumulated stress (subgraph a)) and maximal stress (subgraph d)). 
Positive events in dimensions of romantic and peer relationship reduced adolescents' romantic stress (subgraph b)). 
The occurrence of positive events about peer relationship reduced the RMS value of stress (subgraph c)). 
On the other hand, 
occurrence of positive events caused obvious increase of all positive change modes (subgraph e) to h)),
especially in stressful intervals caused by romantic and peer relationship events. 
The above statistics on stress and positive emotion change modes 
initially reflected stress-buffering effects of different types of positive events
on each dimension of stressor events. 


\paragraph{\textbf{Linguistic expressions}}
%Positive and stressful linguistic expressions were extracted from the microblog content.
%stressful emotion
For each post, we identified following linguistic expressions
applying the segmentation model and parser model in section \ref{sec:frame1}.
The first measure was the frequency of stressful emotional words based on four categories (anger, anxiety, hate, sad) of LICW lexicons,
represented general stressful emotion during the interval ~\citep{Tausczik2010The}.
%positive emotion
The second measure was the frequency of positive emotional words,
which were identified based on four categories (surprise, joy, expectation, love) of LICW lexicons.
\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{\small{Comparing topic words of five dimensions of stressor events during stressful intervals in SI sets and U-SI sets.}}
\label{fig:stopic}
\end{figure}
%stressor topic
The third measure was the frequency of stressor event topic words,
representing the degree of attention for five dimensions of stressor events.
Another important factor was wether self-mentioned words (i.e., \emph{'I','we','my'}) existed, since self-mentioned words exhibited high probability that the current event was related to the author,
rather than the opinion about a public event or life events about others (\citep{Li2014Major}). 
Figure \ref{fig:topicAll} a) and b) showed the frequency of stressful emotional words 
and positive emotional words, respectively. 
The x-axis from P1 to P6 represented the occurrence of six dimensions of positive events, 
and y-axis from S1 to S5 indicated the occurrence of five dimensions of stressor events. 
Positive events from romantic, peer relationship and family life showed obvious 
reduction in stressful emotional words caused by romantic and self-cognition stressor events (subgraph \ref{fig:topicAll} a)). 
While the occurrence of positive emotions exhibited no increase 
for stressful intervals in family life and peer relationship dimensions 
(\ref{fig:topicAll} b)). 
Figure \ref{fig:stopic} (a) to e)) 
showed the distribution of stressful topic words when different positive events occurred. 
Generally, the occurrence of positive events caused increase of stressor topics words. 
We also observed that stressor topics in romantic and self-cognition dimensions 
exhibited similar changing trends.

In addition, figure \ref{fig:stopic} f) showed reduction in stressful 
intervals related to school life, 
while the occurrence of positive events didn't exhibit obvious difference. 

\paragraph{\textbf{Posting behaviors}}
Stress could lead to abnormal posting behaviors,
reflecting user's changes in social engagement activity ~\citep{Liang2015Teenagers}.
We considered three measures of posting behaviors in each time unit (day).
The first measure was \emph{posting frequency},
representing the total number of posts per day.
Research in \cite{Li2017Analyzing} indicated that overwhelmed adolescents tended to post more to express their stress for releasing and seeking comfort from friends.
The second measure was the \emph{positive posting frequency}, indicating the number of positive posts per day.
The third measure \emph{stressful posting frequency} per day highlighted the stressful posts among all posts.
Figure \ref{fig:post}shows the distribution of above three measures in U-SI and SI, respectively.

%The forth measure \emph{original frequency} was the number of original posts,
%which filtered out re-tweet and shared posts.
%Compared to forwarded posts, original posts indicated higher probability that users were talking about themselves.

\subsubsection{Monotonous Model of Stress-buffering}
To verify the monotonous stress changes at both the early and late stress-buffering stages,
for each stressful interval in SI (n=2,582) and U-SI (n=1,914),
we compared its stress intensity with the front and rear adjacent intervals.
For a stressful interval $I = <t_i,t_{i+1},\cdots,t_j>$,
let $I^{front} = <t_m,\cdots,t_{i-1}>$ be the adjacent interval before $I$,
and $I^{rear} = <t_{j+1},\cdots,t_n>$ be the rear adjacent interval of $I$.
The length of $I^{front}$ and $I^{rear}$ are set to $|I|$.
For the set of stressful intervals $SI$ composed of $<I_1,I_2,\cdots,I_N>$,
the corresponding sets of adjacent front and rear intervals are denoted as $SI^{front}$ and $SI^{rear}$.
Similarly, for the set of stressful intervals $USI$ = $<UI_1,UI_2,\cdots, UI_M>$ impacted by positive events,
the corresponding sets of adjacent front and rear intervals are denoted as $USI^{front}$ and $USI^{rear}$.
We compare the intensity of stress changes in following four situations,
where $g(.)$ is the function comparing two sets: \\
1) $g(SI,SI^{front}$) returns if intensive change happens when stressful intervals begin.\\
2) $g(SI,SI^{rear}$) returns if stress changes intensively after the stressful intervals end.\\
3) $g(USI,USI^{front}$) returns if intensive change happens when stressful intervals affected by positive events appears.\\
4) $g(USI,USI^{rear}$) returns if stress changes intensively after stressful intervals affected by positive events end.

In our problem, taking the comparison between $SI$ and $SI^{rear}$ for example,
the basic computation element $I_k \in SI \cup SI^{rear}$ in both sets is a multi-dimension interval.
Here we adopt the t-test method as the intensity computation function $g(.)$.
%The t-test algorithm measures if intensive positive or negative monotonous correlation
%exists between two sample sets.
The function $g(.) = t_{score}$ $\in$ (-1,1) is represented as:

\begin{equation}
\small{g(SI,SI^{rear})}= \frac{\mu_{SI}-\mu_{SI^{rear}}}{\sqrt{\frac{(n_1-1)\sigma^2_{SI}+(n_2-1)\sigma^2_{SI^{rear}}}{n_1+n_2-2}(\frac{1}{n_1}-\frac{1}{n_2})}}
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{SI}$ and $\mu_{SI^{rear}}$ are the mean stress values of intervals in sets $SI$ and $SI^{rear}$,
and $\sigma_{SI}$ and $\sigma_{SI^{rear}}$ are the variance stress values of intervals in sets $SI$ and $SI^{rear}$, respectively.
If $g(SI,SI^{rear})$ $> \alpha$, stress intensity in $SI^{rear}$ show significant decrease compared with $SI$ (monotonic negative effect).
If $g(SI^{front},SI)$ $< -\alpha$, stress intensity in $SI$ show significant increase compared with $SI^{front}$ (monotonic positive effect).
Here we adopt $\alpha$ = 1.96, $P$ = 0.025.
We conduct comparison for above four situations,
to observe whether the occurrence of positive events relieve the monotonic negative effect of $g(SI,SI^{rear})$
and the monotonic positive effect of $g(SI^{front},SI)$.
