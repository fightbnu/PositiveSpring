\subsection{Stress Buffering}{Stress-buffering Pattern of scheduled positive events}
%KTS

Basically, we focused on four scheduled positive events:
\emph{practical activity}, \emph{holiday}, \emph{new year party} and \emph{sports meeting}.
For each of the four scheduled positive events,
we quantified the stress-buffering effect based on corresponding SI and U-SI interval sets of the 124 students.

Table \ref{tab:schedule} shows the experimental results,
where 54.52\%, 78.39\%, 63.39\%, 58.74\% significant stress-buffering effect were detected for the four specific scheduled positive events,
with the total ratio to 69.52\% ($\alpha$ =1.96 for p=0.025).
We adopted the commonly used Pearson correlation algorithm to compare with the two sample statistical method in this study.
The Euclidean metric was used to calculate the distance between two $n$ dimension points $X$ and $Y$.
Experimental results show that our KNN-based two sample method (denoted as KTS) outperformed the baseline method
with the best improvement in \emph{new year party} to 10.94\%,
and total improvement to 6.00\%.

The correlation of positive events a) in each group of microblog measure
and b) towards five dimensions of stress
were shown in box-plots \ref{fig:correlation}.
The stress-buffering pattern of positive events
was closely correlated with posting behavior (ratio = 80.65\%, n=100, SD=1.96),
stress change mode (ratio = 67.74\%, n=84, SD=2.04) and microblog linguistic expressions (ratio = 74.19\%, n=92, SD=2.07).
Positive events conducted most intensive stress-buffering impact on 'family life' (ratio = 83.87\%, n=104, SD=2.72),
followed by 'peer relationships' (ratio = 71.77\%, n=89, SD=4.04) and 'school life' (ratio = 67.74\%, n=84, SD=2.71) dimensions.
The correlation values in 'peer relation'
exhibited the highest 75th percentile while the lowest 25th percentile,
showing a relatively random and unstable stress-buffering effect on this dimension.
Comparing the hypothesis test results on scheduled positive events (ratio = 69.52\%)
and automatically extracted positive events (ratio = 74.21\%),
the result indicated the feasibility of automatically extracting positive events from microblogs.
