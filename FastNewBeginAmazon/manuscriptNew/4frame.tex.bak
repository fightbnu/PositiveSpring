\section{Framework}
\subsection{Discovery of Positive Events from Microblogs}
We first introduce the procedure to extract positive event and its intervals from microblogs, 
thus to extend our study to various types of positive events. 
Let $u$ = $[type,\{doer, act,$ $description\}]$ be a positive event,
where the element \emph{doer} is the subject who performs the \emph{act},
and \emph{descriptions} are the key words related to $u$.
According to psychological scales \citep{Jun2008Influence,hassles},
adolescent positive events mainly focus on six dimensions, 
as $\mathbb{U} =\{$ 'entertainment', 'school life', 'romantic', 'pear relationship', 'self-cognition', 'family life'$\}$. We constructed our lexicon for six-dimensional positive events from two sources. 
The basic positive words are selected from the psychological lexicon C-LIWC (e.g., expectation, joy, love and surprise)~\citep{Tausczik2010The}. 
Then we built six topic lexicons by expanding basic positive words from adolescent microblogs,
containing 452 phrases in 'entertainment',
273 phrases in 'school life',
138 phrases in 'romantic',
91 phrases in 'peer relationship',
299 phrases in 'self-recognition' and 184 phrases in 'family life', with totally 2,606 phrases,
as examples shown in table \ref{tab:topicWords}.
Additionally, we labeled \emph{doer} words (i.e., \emph{teacher}, \emph{mother}, \emph{I, we}) in positive lexicons.

\paragraph{Linguistic parser model} 
Positive events were identified through Chinese natural language processing platform \citep{Che2010}. 
For each post, after word segmentation, we parsed each sentence to find its linguistic structure, 
and then matched the main linguistic components with positive topic lexicons in each dimension. 
The linguistic parser model was applied to identify the central verb of current sentence, namely the \emph{act}. 
It constructed the relationship between the central verb and corresponding \emph{doer} and \emph{description} elements.
By searching these elements in positive topic lexicons, 
the existence of positive events were identified. 
Due to the sparsity of posts, the element \emph{act} might be empty.
\emph{Descriptions} were collected by searching all nouns, adjectives and adverbs. 
Examples of positive events extracted from adolescents' microblogs are listed in table \ref{tab:uplifts}.
For the post 'Thanks all my dear friends hosting the party. Happiest birthday!!!', 
it was processed as \emph{doer='friends', act = 'expecting', description = 'party'}, 
and \emph{type = 'entertainment'}.

\paragraph{Impact Intervals of Positive Events}
We followed and extended work~\citep{Li2017Analyzing} to identify the impact interval of each positive event to further study its stress-buffering pattern.
Splitting interval is a common time series problem, and here we identified the target interval in three steps. 
Step1. Identify candidate intervals. We extracted positive events, stressor events and filtered out candidate intervals after a smoothing process.
For each candidate interval, 
we set its length to more than 3 days and a maximum gap of 1 day between two neighboured stressed days. 
Since the stress series detected from microblogs were discrete points, 
the loess method was adopted to highlight characteristics of the stress curve. 
Step2. Judge stressful intervals through hypothesis testing. 
For each candidate interval, 
a Poisson based probability model was adopted to measure how confidently the current interval was a stressful interval. 
Here the stressful posting rates under stress $\lambda_1$ and normal conditions $\lambda_0$ were modeled as two independent poisson process: 
\begin{equation}
Pr[N=n|\lambda_i]=\frac{e^{-\lambda_i T}{(\lambda_i T)}^n}{n!}
\end{equation}
where $i\in\{0,1\}$, $n=0,1,\cdots,\infty$. 
We expected that $\lambda_1 > \lambda_0$, and measured the probability as $P(\lambda_1>\lambda_0|N_1, T_1, N_0, T_0)$,
where $N_1, N_0$ are the number of stressful posts, and $T_1, T_0$ are time duration corresponding to $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_0$.
Without loss of generality, we assume a Jeffreys non-informative prior on $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_0$,
and inferred the posterior distribution $P(\lambda_1|N_1)$ and $P(\lambda_0|N_0)$ according to Bayes Rule.
Thus for current interval $I_1$ and historical normal interval $I_0$, 
the quantified probability $\beta = P(\lambda_1>\lambda_0|I_1,I_0)$ $\in (0,1)$ indicated the confidence 
whether $I_1$ was a stressful interval.
Step 3. Divided stressful intervals into SI set and U-SI set in temporal order. 
For a detected stressful interval $I = <t_1,\cdots,t_n>$, we considered the temporal order between $I$ and any detected positive event $u$ happening at time point $t_u$: 
\paragraph{1)} If the positive event $u$ happened during the stressful interval, i.e., $t_u \in [t_1,t_n]$, the positive interval $I$ was judged as $I \in U-SI$.
\paragraph{2)} If the positive event happened nearby a stressful interval, 
considering the probability that it conducted impact on current stressful interval.
Here the gap between $t_u$ and $I$ is limited to $\xi$, i.e., 
if $t_u \in [t_{1}-\xi, t_1)\cup(t_{n},t_{n}+\xi]$, then $I \in U-SI$.
If a stressful interval satisfies none of the above conditions, we classify it into the SI set.
