\section{Introduction}
\emph{Motivation}: Life is always full of ups and downs. 
Accumulated stress could drain inner resources,
leading to psychological maladjustment, depression and even suicidal behaviours \citep{Nock2008Suicide}.
Compared with adults, young people exhibit more exposure to stress 
due to the immature inner status and lack of experience \citep{older}. 
According to the latest report released by American Psychological Association in 2018,
91\% of youngest adults had experienced physical or emotional symptoms due to stress in the past month compared to 74\% of adults \citep{APA2018}.
More than 30 million Chinese adolescents are suffering from psychological stress,
and nearly 30\% of them have a risk of depression \citep{ChinaTeen2019}.
Stress-induced mental health problems are becoming an important social issue worldwide.

On the other hand, positive life events, such as satisfying social interactions,
excellent academic performance and pleasant entertainment activities,
could exert protective effects on emotional distress in both directly and indirectly ways by \emph{'buffering'} ~\citep{Shahar2002Positive, Cohen2010Positive}, 
with respect to physiological, psychological, and social coping resources~\citep{Cohen1984Positive,Needles1990Positive}. 
Researchers indicated that positive events mitigated the relation between negative events and maladjustment in samples of adolescents experiencing family transitions \citep{Doyle2003Positive}. 
The written expression of positive feelings had also been proven to prompt increased cognitive re-organization among an undergraduate student group \citep{Coolidge2009A}. 
Positive events also have been linked to medical benefits, such as improving mood, serum cortisol levels, and lower levels of inflammation and hypercoagulability \citep{Caputo1998Influence,Jain2010Effects}. 
Thus, tracking the state of stress-buffering is important for understanding the mental status of stressed individuals.

\emph{Existing solutions}:
Previous studies have been focusing on conducting one-time measurement of positive events and stress-buffering state after events, i.e., 
Hassles \& Uplifts Scales~~\citep{Kanner1981Comparison},
Perceived Benefit Scales~\citep{Mcmillen1998The}, 
Interpretation of Positive Events Scale~\citep{Alden2008Social} 
and Adolescent Self-Rating Life Events Checklist~~~\citep{Jun2008Influence}.
Recent scholars have demonstrated the feasibility to sense and predict users' stress from social networks~\citep{XueUbicomp13,Xue2014Detecting,Lin2014User,Li2015When,Li2015Predicting,Li2015Using,
Li2017Analyzing,Li2017Exploring}, 
through content (linguistic text, emoticons, pictures) 
and behavioral (abnormal posting time, comment/response actions) measures.

The aforementioned.....
The subjective self-report investigations were limited by manpower,
and susceptible to many factors, such as social appreciation and pressure from measurement scenarios. 
We aim to continually mine the restoring impact of positive events leveraging abundant data source from microblogs,
to further provide guidance for school and parents that when and which kind of positive events could help relieve students' overwhelmed stress in both stress prevention and stress early stopping situations.

\emph{Our work}: 
To this end, the current study aims to contribute to this growing area of interdisciplinary research
by examining the potential relationship between positive events and stress-buffering pattern
from adolescents' microblog content and behavioral characteristics. 
%--------------------

Given the limitations in the existing literature,
this study examined the relationship between positive events and stress-buffering pattern
based on adolescents' microblog content and behaviors.
Two hypotheses were tested. 
\textbf{H1}: The stress-buffering effect of positive events is correlated with
a)posting behavior, b)stress change mode and c)microblog linguistic expressions.
\textbf{H2}: Positive events buffers monotonous stress changes at both the early stage (before stress beginning)
and late stage (after the end of stress).
In response to the theoretical hypothesis,
we propose new measurement methods in a non-invasion way based on public social network data.
Two research questions are proposed:
1) How to (a) automatically extract the positive events experienced by adolescents from microblogs,
and (b) identify the time interval impacted by a particular positive event.
2) How to quantify the stress-buffering effect of positive events based on above microblog characteristics.

A pilot study was firstly conducted on the microblog data set (n=29,232) of a group of high school students (n=500)
associated with the school's scheduled positive events (n=259) and stressor events (n=518).
After observing the posting behaviors and contents of stressed students under the influence of positive events,
several implications were discussed to guide the next step research.

Next, we extract uplift events and the corresponding impacted interval from microblogs.
We define and extract structural uplift events from posts using linguistic parser model based
on six-dimensional uplift scale and LIWC lexicons.
Independent stressful intervals (SI) and stressful intervals impacted by uplifts (U-SI) are extracted considering temporal orders.
%
A Chinese linguistic parser model was applied to extract structural positive events. 
%2
We examined the relationship between the stress-buffering pattern
of positive events and adolescents' microblog characteristics 
through three groups of measures
(posting behaviour, stress change mode, linguistic expressions). 
%3
The stress-buffering effect was modeled as the statistical difference in two comparative situations.
%4
We also tracked the dynamic process of stress-buffering pattern,
and quantify the monotonous stress-buffering impact in temporal order. 
%
and model the impact of uplift events as the statistical difference between the sets of SI and U-SI in two aspects:
the two-sample based method is employed for variation detection,
and the t-test correlation is conducted to judge the monotonous correlation.


%-------------------------------------------------%
To model such a practical application problem, several challenges exist.
\emph{How to extract uplift events from microblogs and identify corresponding impact interval}?
The impact of uplift events is highlighted when the teen is under stress, with various relative temporal order.
Extracting such scenarios from teen's messy microblogs is the first and basic challenge for further analysis.
\emph{How to qualitatively and quantitatively measure the restoring impact conducted by uplift events}?
There are multiple clues related to teens' behaviours from microblogs, i.e.,
depressive linguistic content, abnormal posting behaviours.
The teen might act differently under similar stressful situations when the uplift event happens or not.
It is challenging to find such hidden correlation between uplift events and teen's behavioural characters.
