\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
In this paper, 
we give a deep inside into the stress easing function of uplift events on the real data set of 124 high school students.
A two-sample based statistical model is conducted to analyze the stressful behavioral correlations
when uplift events happened to overwhelmed students from multiple perspectives.
Experimental results show that our method could measure the restoring impact of school scheduled uplift events efficiently, and integrating the impact of uplift events helps reduce the stress prediction errors.
Our research provides guidance for school and parents that
which kind of uplift events could help relieve students' overwhelmed stress
in both stress prevention and stress early stopping situations.
Our future work will focus on digging the overlap impact of multiple uplift events in more complex situations, as well as the frequent appearing patterns of different types of uplift events and stressor events,
thus to provide more accurate analysis and restoring guidance for individual teenagers.
