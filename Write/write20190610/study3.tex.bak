\section{Study3: Quantify the impact of uplift events}
To quantify the restoring impact of uplift event,
in this section, we propose to model the impact as the teen's behavioral differences in two cases:
1) stressful intervals unaffected by uplift events (SI), and 2) stressful intervals impacted by uplift events (U-SI).
Multiple stress and positive emotion related measures are proposed to describe the correlation between SI and U-SI,
and we quantify such differences as correlations using a two-sample based statistical method.

\subsection{Restoring Patterns and Behavioral Measures}
\label{subsec:pattern}
To extract the restoring patterns \bm{${A}$} for each type of uplift events,
we describe a teen's positive and stressful behavioral measures in SI and U-SI sets from three aspects:
posting behavior, stress intensity, and linguistic expressions.
%For an uplift event $u$ with type $U^{'}$,
%a stressor event $e$ with type $S^{'}$,
%let $F$:$(u, U^{'}, e, S^{'}) \rightarrow $ \bm{${A}$}
%(\bm{${A}$} is a multidimensional vector) be the stress-buffering effect of uplift event $u$
%conducted on the stress caused by stressor event $e$.

\textbf{Posting behavior}.
Stress could lead to a teen's abnormal posting behaviors,
reflecting the teen's changes in social engagement activity.
For each stressful interval,
we consider three measures of posting behaviors in each time unit (day),
and present each measure as a corresponding series.
The first measure is \emph{posting frequency},
representing the total number of posts per day.
Research in \cite{Li2017Analyzing} indicates that overwhelmed teens usually tend to post more to express their stress for releasing
and seeking comfort from friends.
Further, the second measure \emph{stressful posting frequency} per day
is based on previous stress detection result and highlights the stressful posts among all posts.
Similarly, the third measure is the \emph{positive posting frequency}, indicating the number of positive posts per day.
The forth measure \emph{original frequency} is the number of original posts, which filters out re-tweet and shared posts.
Compared to forwarded posts, original posts indicate higher probability that teens are talking about themselves.
Thus for each day in current interval, the teen's posting behavior is represented as a four-dimension vector.

\textbf{Stress intensity}.
We describe the global stress intensity during a stressful interval through four measures:
\emph{sequential stress level, length, RMS,} and \emph{peak}.
Basically, \emph{stress level} per day constructs a sequential measure during a stressful interval,
recording stress values and fluctuation on each time point.
The \emph{length} measures the lasting time of current stressful interval.
As uplift events might conduct impact on overwhelmed teens,
and postpone the beginning or promote the end of the stressful interval,
we take the \emph{length} as a factor representing the interval stress intensity.
To quantify the intensity of fluctuations for stress values,
we adopt the \emph{RMS} (root mean square) of stress values through the interval as the third measure.
In addition, the \emph{peak} stress value is also a measure to show the maximal stress value in current interval.

\textbf{Linguistic expressions}.
We extract the teen's positive and stressful expressions from the content of posts in SI and U-SI sets, respectively.
The first linguistic measure is the frequency of \emph{positive word},
which represents the positive emotion in current interval.
The second measure is the frequency of \emph{uplift event topic words} in six dimensions,
reflecting the existence of uplift events.
Another important factor is wether existing \emph{self-mentioned words} (i.e., \emph{'I','we','my'}).
Self-mentioned words show high probability that the current stressor event and stressful emotion is related to the author,
rather than the opinion about a public event or life events about others.

Except uplift-related linguistic descriptions, we also take stressful linguistic characters as measures,
which is opposite with positive measures, while also offers information from the complementary perspective.
The first stressful linguistic measure is the frequency of \emph{stressor event topic words} in five dimensions,
which represents how many times the teen mentioned a stressor event,
indicating the degree of attention for each type of stressor event.
The frequency of \emph{pressure words} is the second stressful linguistic measure,
reflecting the degree of general stress emotion during the interval.
We adopt this measure specifically because in some cases teens post very short tweets with only stressful emotional words,
where topic-related words are omitted.

Next,
based on the posting behavior, stress intensity and linguistic measures from both the stressful and positive views,
we quantify the difference between SI and U-SI sets, thus to measure the impact of uplift events.

\subsection{Quantify the Correlation}
In our problem,
there are two sets of stressful intervals to compare:
the SI set and the U-SI set,
containing stressful intervals unaffected by uplift events
and stressful intervals impacted by uplift events, respectively.
The basic elements in each set are stressful intervals,
i.e., the sequential stress values in time line,
which are modeled as multi-dimensional points according to the three groups of measures in section \ref{subsec:pattern}.
Thus we formulate this comparison problem as finding the correlation between the two sets of multi-dimension points.
Specifically, we adopt the multivariate two-sample hypothesis testing method
\cite{Li2017Correlating,Johnson2012Applied} to model such correlation.
In this two-sample hypothesis test problem,
the basic idea is judging whether the multi-dimension points (i.e., stressful intervals)
in set SI and set U-SI are under different statistical distribution.
Assuming the data points in SI and U-SI are randomly sampled from distribution $F^{(1)}$ and $F^{(2)}$, respectively,
then the hypothesis is denoted as:
\begin{equation}
H_0: F^{(1)} =F^{(2)} \quad versus \quad H_1: F^{(1)} \neq F^{(2)}.
\end{equation}

Under such hypothesis,
$H_0$ indicates points in SI and U-SI are under similar distribution,
while $H_1$ means points in SI and U-SI are under statistically different distributions,
namely uplift events have conducted obvious restoring impact on current stressed teen.
Next, we handle this two-sample hypothesis test problem based on both positive and stressful behavioral measures
(i.e., \emph{posting behavior}, \emph{stress intensity} and \emph{linguisitc expressions}),
thus to quantify the restoring patterns of uplift events from multi perspectives.

As a classic statistical topic, various algorithms have been proposed to solve the two-sample hypothesis testing problem.
Since each point in the two sets (SI and U-SI) is depicted in multi-dimensions,
here we take the KNN (k nearest neighbors) \cite{Schilling1986Multivariate}
based method to judge the existence of significant difference between SI and U-SI.
For simplify, we use the symbol $A_1$ to represent set SI,
and $A_2$ represent set U-SI,
namely $A_1$ and $A_2$ are two sets composed of stressful intervals.
In the KNN algorithm,
for each point $\ell_{x}$ in the two sets $A_1$ and $A_2$,
we expect its nearest neighbors (\emph{the most similar points}) belonging to the same set of $\ell_x$,
which indicates the difference between the points in the two cases.
The model derivation process is described in detail in the \ref{mod:mod1} part of the appendix.

\subsection{Temporal Order}
\label{sec:temporal}
To measure the temporal order of stress changes in the two sets of intervals (SI and U-SI) ,
we further compare each interval with the front and rear adjacent intervals, respectively.
%denoted as $SI^{front}$, $SI^{rear}$, $USI^{front}$, $USI^{rear}$.
%We compare the intensity of stress changes in four situations,
%
%where $g(.)$ is the function comparing two sets:
%1) $g(SI,SI^{front}$) returns if intensive change happens when stressful intervals begin;
%2) $g(SI,SI^{rear}$) returns if the teen's stress change intensively after the stressful intervals end
%3) $g(USI,USI^{front}$) returns if intensive change happens when stressful intervals affected by uplift events appears.
%4)  $g(USI,USI^{rear}$) returns if stress change intensively after stressful intervals affected by uplift events end.

Here we adopt the t-test method as the intensity computation function,
to observe whether the occurrence of uplift events relieve the monotonic negative effect and the monotonic positive effect.
Details are presents in part \ref{mod:mod2} of the appendix.

The overall pipeline for identifying the restoring impact of uplift events is presented in algorithm \ref{alg:alg4}

%\subsection{Overall Algorithm}
%The overall pipeline for identifying the restoring impact of uplift events is presented in algorithm \ref{alg:alg4}.
%1) To quantify the restoring impact of uplift events,
%we first extract uplift events and stressful intervals from the teen's microblogs.
%All stressful intervals are classified into two sets:
%the set of stressful intervals affected by uplift events (SI),
%and the set of stressful intervals impacted by uplift events (U-SI).
%2) To judge if SI are statistically different with U-SI,
%next, the two-sample hypothesis testing method is conducted on the two sets
%with multi positive and stressful measures (posting behavior, stress intensity and linguistic expressions).
%3) To further judge the monotonous restoring intensity of each type of uplift events,
%the final step comes to comparing SI and U-SI with adjacent intervals, respect to temporal order.

\paragraph{Restoring Impact of scheduled uplift events}
Basically, we focused on four kinds of scheduled positive events:
\emph{practical activity}, \emph{holiday}, \emph{new year party} and \emph{sports meeting}.
For each of the four scheduled positive events,
we quantify the restoring impact and temporal order
based on corresponding SI and U-SI interval sets of the 124 students.
Table \ref{tab:schedule} shows the experimental results,
where 54.52\%, 78.39\%, 63.39\%, 58.74\% significant restoring impact are detected for the four specific scheduled positive events, respectively, with the total accuracy to 69.52\%.

\paragraph{Baseline methods}
We adopt the commonly used Pearson correlation algorithms to compare with the two sample statistical method in this study.
As a widely adopted measure of the linear correlation between two variables,
the Pearson correlation method computes a value in the range ($-1,1$),
where 1 denotes total positive linear correlation,
0 denotes no linear correlation,
and $-1$ is total negative linear correlation.
In our two sample statistical procedure,
to calculate the distance between two $n$ dimension points $X$ and $Y$,
we adopt the Euclidean metric.

For comparison,
our knn-based two sample method (denoted as \emph{KTS}) outperforms the baseline method
with the best improvement in \emph{new year party} to 10.94\%,
and total improvement to 6\%.
The correlation of uplift events for \emph{linguistic expression},
\emph{stress intensity} and \emph{post behaviors} towards five types of stressor events
are shown in Figure \ref{fig:correlation},
among which the uplift events conduct most intensive restoring impact in 'school life' and 'peer relationship' dimensions.

\end{figure}


\paragraph{Monotonous stress changes caused by uplift events}
Further more,
to verify the monotonous stress changes when an uplift event impacts a stressful interval,
we collected 1,914 stressful intervals in U-SI,
and 2,582 stressful intervals impacted by uplift events in SI.
For each stressful interval in SI and U-SI,
we quantify its stress intensity by comparing with the front and rear adjacent intervals, respectively.
Here four situations are considered and compared according to the temporal order in Section \ref{sec:temporal},
as shown in Table \ref{tab:fontrear},
where the \emph{ratio of intervals} detected with monotonous increase from the \emph{front interval} to \emph{stressful interval} (denoted as \emph{front$ \rightarrow$ I}),
and monotonous decrease from the \emph{stressful interval} to the \emph{rear interval} (denoted as \emph{I $\rightarrow$ rear}) are listed.
Under the impact of uplift events,
both the ratio of intensive stress increase in \emph{front$ \rightarrow$ I}
and the ratio of intensive stress decrease in \emph{I $\rightarrow$ rear} are decreased,
showing the effectiveness of the two sample method for quantifying the impact of uplift events,
and the rationality of the assumption that uplift events could help ease stress of overwhelmed teens.
