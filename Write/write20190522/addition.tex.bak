\section{Addition}
\paragraph{Study1}
To further observe the influence of uplift events for students facing stressor events,
we statistic all the stressful intervals~\cite{Li2017Analyzing} detected surround the scheduled examinations over the 124 students during their high school career.
For each student, we divide all his/her stressful intervals into two sets:
1) stressful intervals under the influence of neighbouring uplift events (e.g., \emph{Halloween activity}), and 2) independent stressful intervals.
Figure~\ref{fig:frequency} shows five measures of each student during the above two conditions:
the \emph{accumulated stress}, the \emph{average stress} (per day), the \emph{length of stressful intervals},
the \emph{frequency of academic topic words}, and the \emph{ratio of academic stress among all types of stress}.
For each measure, we calculate the average value over all eligible slides for each student.

%Given an uplift event with specific type,
%we consider its restoring impact by comparing the teen's behavioral measures under two situations.
%As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:SI},
%in the original situation (i.e., sub-series A),
%the teen's stress is caused by a stressor event, lasting for a period,
%and no other intervention (namely, uplift event) occurs.
%We call the set of such stressful intervals as \textbf{SI}.
%In the other comparative situation (i.e., sub-series B),
%the teen's stressful interval caused by the same type of stressor is impacted by an uplift event with type $x$,
%we call the set of such stressful intervals as \textbf{U-SI}.
%Thus the difference under the two situations SI and U-SI could be seen as the restoring impact conducted by the uplift event of type $x$.

\subsection{Find the Impact Interval of A Positive Event}
%\section{Study4:Predicting the mitigation of psychological stress in adolescents by positive events}
When an uplift event happens, it can conduct positive impact on stressed teens,
which may exhibit in multi-perspectives,
including the length of corresponding stressful interval, the stress intensity and stressful behaviors during the interval.
Basically, in this part, we identify stressful intervals from timeline thus to support further quantifying the influence of an uplift event.
Splitting interval is a common time series problem, and various solutions could be referred.
Here we identify the teen's stressful intervals in three steps.
In the first step, we extract uplift events, stressor events and filter out candidate intervals after a smoothing process.
Then, applying the Poisson based statistical method proposed in~\cite{Li2017Analyzing},
we judge whether each candidate interval is a confidential stressful interval.
Finally, we divide the stressful intervals into two sets: the SI set and the U-SI set,
according to its temporal order with neighboring uplift events.

\emph{Smooth stress series}.
Since a teen's stress series $S=\{s_1, s_2, \cdots, s_n\}$ detected from microblogs (aggrated by day) are discrete points,
we adopt the loess (local regression using weighted linear least squares and a $2^{nd}$ degree polynomial) method \cite{Cleveland1988Locally} to highlight characteristics of the stress curve.
In loess method, we need to set the parameter \emph{span},
which represents the percentage of the selected data points in the whole data set (ranging from 0 to 1),
and determines the degree of smoothing.
We discuss the influence of different \emph{span} settings on the result of interval segmentation in the experiment section.
%to be add 1: interval parameter.

\emph{Select candidate intervals.}
We filter out candidate stressful intervals on the smoothed stress series $S^{'}=\{s^{'}_1,s^{'}_2,\cdots,s^{'}_n\}$.
%As illustrated in Figure xx, w
Let the sub-series $w_{<a,b>} = [s^{'}_a, \cdots, s^{'}_b]$ as a \emph{wave},
where $s^{'}_v$ $= {vally(w_{<a,b>})}$ is the minimum stress value,
$s^{'}_p$ $= peak(w_{<a,b>})$ is the maximal stress value during $\{s^{'}_a,\cdots,s^{'}_b\}$,
and $s^{'}_a \leq s^{'}_{a+1} \leq \cdots \leq s^{'}_p \leq s^{'}_{p+1} \leq \cdots \leq s^{'}_b$.
A candidate interval $I = <w_1,\cdots, w_i,\cdots, w_m>$ is identified with following rules:
\begin{itemize}
\item $s^{'}_1 = 0$, $s^{'}_m = 0$. $\forall s^{'}_j \in \{s^{'}_2,\cdots,s^{'}_{m-1}\}$, $s^{'}_j > 0$.
\item Let wave $w_i$ be the biggest wave in current candidate interval, with $peak(w_i) = \omega$,
$\forall $ wave $w_j \in I$, $peak(w_j)<=peak(w_i)$.
\item For waves $w_k$ before the interval biggest wave $w_i$ , i.e., $\forall w_k \in <w_1,\cdots,w_{i-1}>$,
$peak(w_{k+1})>=peak(w_k)$, $vally(w_{k+1}) >= peak(w_k)$.
\item For waves $w_k$ behind the interval biggest wave $w_i$, i.e.,  $w_k \in <w_{i}, \cdots, w_m>$,
$peak(w_{k+1})<=peak(w_k)$, $vally(w_{k+1}) <= peak(w_k)$.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Identify stressful intervals.}
For each candidate interval,
a Poisson based probability model~\cite{Li2017Analyzing} is adopted to measure how confidently the current interval is a stressful interval.
Here a teen's stressful posting rate under stress ($\lambda_1$) and normal conditions ($\lambda_0$) are modeled as two independent poisson process:
\begin{equation}
Pr[N=n|\lambda_i]=\frac{e^{-\lambda_i T}{(\lambda_i T)}^n}{n!}
\end{equation}
where $i\in\{0,1\}$, $n=0,1,\cdots,\infty$.
We expect that $\lambda_1 > \lambda_0$, and measure the probability as $P(\lambda_1>\lambda_0|N_1, T_1, N_0, T_0)$,
where $N_1, N_0$ are the number of stressful posts, and $T_1, T_0$ are time duration corresponding to $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_0$.
Without loss of generality, we assume a Jeffreys non-informative prior on $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_0$,
and infer the posterior distribution $P(\lambda_1|N_1)$ and $P(\lambda_0|N_0)$ according to Bayes Rule.
Thus for current interval $I_1$ and historical normal interval $I_0$,
the quantified probability $\beta = P(\lambda_1>\lambda_0|I_1,I_0)$ $\in (0,1)$ indicates the confidence whether $I_1$ is a stressful interval.

\emph{Intervals impacted by uplift events.}
In this part, we filter out two sets of stressful intervals: stressful intervals without the impact of uplift events (SI),
and stressful intervals under the impact of uplift events (U-SI).
For a detected stressful interval $I = <t_1,\cdots,t_n>$, we consider the temporal order between $I$ and any detected uplift event $u$ happened at time point $t_u$:
\begin{itemize}
\item If the uplift event $u$ happens during the stressful interval, i.e., $t_u \in [t_1,t_n]$, the uplift interval $I$ is judged as $I \in SI$.
\item For the uplift event happening nearby a stressful interval,
we also consider the probability that it conducts impact on the teen's stressful interval.
Here the gap between $t_u$ and $I$ is limited to $\xi$, i.e.,
if $t_u \in [t_{1}-\xi, t_1)\cup(t_{n},t_{n}+\xi]$, then $I \in SI$.
%The setting of parameter $\xi$ is discussed in experiment section.
\end{itemize}
If a stressful interval satisfies none of the above conditions, we classify it into the U-SI set.
