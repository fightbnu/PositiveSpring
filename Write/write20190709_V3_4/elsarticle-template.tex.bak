\begin{abstract}
Studies have shown that the occurrence of positive events could conduct stress-buffering functions.
Mastering the process and characteristics of stress-buffering is necessary to understand the mental health status of overwhelmed individuals.
%1.主观自陈
The assessment of stress-buffering in previous studies was mainly conducted through subjective self-reporting, and was influenced by many factors, such as social appreciation and pressure from measurement scenarios.
However, there is a lack of research on the stress-buffering characteristics that individuals actually exhibit at the behavioral level.
%2.静态视觉
At the same time,
previous studies has been based on static perspectives,
focusing on single measurements of events and psychological state after events, while the dynamic process of stress-buffering was difficult to track due to the lack of effective scientific method.
%social network
With the widespread use of social networks, users often exhibit natural self-discipline and rich behavioral characteristics.
%problems 1)表现 2)动态过程
So, what is the potential link between the stress-buffering function of positive events and the user's microblogging behaviors?
How to automatically observe the behavioral characteristics of stress-buffering through microblogs,
and further capture the dynamic process of stress-buffering?
%本文解决两个问题：
This study provided two solutions to the above two problems.
We first tested the potential relationship between positive events and individual's microblogging behaviors,
in order to replace the subjective self-reported assessment method.
Further, based on the microblog sequence,
this paper studied the dynamic perspective of the stress-buffering process,
rather than a static investigation.
We conduct our study on the data set of 500 high school students.
Our exploration provides guidance for school and parents that which kind of positive events could help relieve adolescent' stress in both stress prevention and stress early stopping situations.

\section{Introduction}
Life is always full of ups and downs.
Accumulated stress comes from daily hassles,
major stressful events and environmental stressors could drain inner resources,
leading to psychological maladjustment, such as depression and suicidal behaviours \citep{Nock2008Suicide}.
According to the newest report of American Psychological Association,
91 percent of youngest adults say they have experienced physical or emotional symptom due to stress in the past month compared to 74 percent of adults overall \citep{APA2018}.
More than 30 million Chinese teenagers are suffering from psychological stress,
and nearly 30\% of them have a risk of depression \citep{ChinaTeen2019}.
Stress-induced mental health problems are becoming an important social issue worldwide.
%1.心理压力问题很严重

Studies have found that the occurrence of positive events could conduct exert obvious protective effects on emotional distress, that is, \emph{stress-buffering} ~\citep{Cohen1984Positive, Folkman1997Positive, Needles1990Positive, Folkman2010Stress, Shahar2002Positive}.
As an essential process in human's stress coping system,
stress-buffering helps individuals get out of overwhelmed status ~\citep{Susan1984Stress,Wheeler1988Identification,Cohen2010Positive}.
Thus, accurately assessing the state of stress-buffering is important for judging the mental health trends of overwhelmed individuals.
%2.积极事件可以缓解心理压力。

Assessing people's stress-buffering status was not a trivial task.
Previous assessments of stress-buffering were mainly conducted through subjective self-reporting \citep{Kanner1981Comparison, Alden2008Social, Mcmillen1998The, Jun2008Influence},
which was influenced by many factors, such as social appreciation and pressure from measurement scenarios.
However, there is a lack of research on the stress-buffering characteristics that individuals actually exhibit at the behavioral level.
At the same time,
previous studies has been based on static perspectives,
focusing on single measurements of positive events and psychological state after events \citep{Chang2015Loneliness, Evan2014Social, Santos2013The},
while the dynamic process of stress-buffering was difficult to track due to the lack of effective scientific methods.
%3.已有方法存在的确定。

As the social media is becoming deeply woven into our daily life,
an increasing number of natural self-disclosures are taking place,
thus providing a new channel for timely,
content-rich and non-invasive exploration of adolescents' mental health status.
%4.随着社交媒体大数据兴起，为探索用户心理健康状态提供了及时/非侵入的新途径。
Previous studies have shown the feasibility and reliability to sense user's psychological stress and stressor events,
and predict future development of stress through social network \citep{Li2015Predicting, Xue2014Detecting, Lin2014User, Li2017Analyzing}.
%5.前期研究表明，通过社交网络数据，可以检测心理压力，压力源事件，预测未来心理压力趋势等，是可行的，可靠的。
The current study aims to contribute to this growing area of interdisciplinary  research by examining
the potential relationship between positive events and adolescent's microblogging behaviors,
and track the stress-buffering process in a dynamic perspective from microblogs.
