\begin{abstract}
Stress is viewed as the leading cause of public mental health issues.
Positive events, however, could act as a buffer against stress.
%1.主观自陈 %2.静态视觉
Since the stress-buffering effect of positive events in previous studies was mainly examined
by subjective self-reporting,
continuous tracking research at individual behavioral levels still remains to be explored.
In this study,
We collected microblogs (n=29,232) from a high school student group (n=500) to examine the relationship
between positive events and stress-buffering pattern based on micro-blog content and behavioral characteristics.
%result1
Through a pilot study we found that the stress-buffering pattern of school scheduled positive events (n=259)
was manifested in both the reduction of stress intensity,
the shorter duration of stress intervals,
and talking less about academic words on micro-blog.
%result2
The hypothetical tests for stress-buffering pattern and monotonic effect of stress changes
were further conducted based on automatical extracted positive events (n=1,914) from microblogs.
The stress-buffering pattern of positive events
was closely correlated with posting behavior (80.65\%, SD=1.96),
stress change mode (67.74\%, SD=2.04) and microblog linguistic expressions (74.19\%, SD=2.07).
Positive events conduct most intensive stress-buffering impact in 'family life' (83.87\%,SD=2.72),
followed by 'peer relationships' (71.77\%, SD=4.04) and 'school life' (67.74\%, SD=2.71) dimensions.
%restul3
Positive events buffered monotonous stress changes at both the early (11.88\% reduction) and late stages (5.88\% reduction).
This study could inform the use of social network to reach and track the mental status transition of adolescents under stress.
The theoretical and practical implications, limitations of this study and future work were discussed.

\section{Introduction}
Life is always full of ups and downs.
Accumulated stress could drain inner resources,
leading to psychological maladjustment, depression and even suicidal behaviours \citep{Nock2008Suicide}. 
According to the latest report released by American Psychological Association in 2018,
91\% of youngest adults had experienced physical or emotional symptoms due to stress in the past month compared to 74 percent of adults \citep{APA2018}. 
More than 30 million Chinese adolescents are suffering from psychological stress, 
and nearly 30\% of them have a risk of depression \citep{ChinaTeen2019}.
Stress-induced mental health problems are becoming an important social issue worldwide. 
%1.心理压力问题很严重

Studies have found that the occurrence of positive events 
could exert protective effects on emotional distress, 
that is, \emph{stress-buffering} ~\citep{Cohen1984Positive, Folkman1997Positive, Needles1990Positive, Folkman2010Stress, Shahar2002Positive}.
As an essential process in human's stress coping system,
stress-buffering helps individuals get out of overwhelmed status 
~\citep{Susan1984Stress,Wheeler1988Identification,Cohen2010Positive}.
Thus, tracking the state of stress-buffering is important for understanding the mental health trends of overwhelmed individuals. 
%2.积极事件可以缓解心理压力。
 
However, tracking individual stress-buffering state is not a trivial task. 
Previous studies on stress-buffering were mainly conducted through subjective self-reporting, 
which was susceptible to many factors, such as social appreciation and pressure from measurement scenarios~\citep{Kanner1981Comparison, Alden2008Social, Mcmillen1998The, Jun2008Influence}. 
There is a lack of research on the stress-buffering characteristics that individuals actually exhibit at the behavioral level.
At the same time, 
previous studies have been based on static perspective, 
focusing on one-time measurement of positive events and stress-buffering state after events \citep{Chang2015Loneliness, Evan2014Social, Santos2013The}. 
The dynamic process of stress-buffering was difficult to track due to the lack of effective scientific methods.
%3.已有方法存在的确定。

As the social media is becoming deeply woven into our daily life,
an increasing number of natural self-disclosures are taking place,
thus providing a new channel for timely,
content-rich and non-invasive exploration of adolescents' mental health status.
%4.随着社交媒体大数据兴起，为探索用户心理健康状态提供了及时/非侵入的新途径。
Previous studies have shown the feasibility and reliability to sense user's psychological stress and stressor events,
and predict future development of stress through social network \citep{Li2015Predicting, Xue2014Detecting, Lin2014User, Li2017Analyzing}.
%5.前期研究表明，通过社交网络数据，可以检测心理压力，压力源事件，预测未来心理压力趋势等，是可行的，可靠的。
The current study aims to contribute to this growing area of interdisciplinary  research by examining
the potential relationship between positive events and adolescent's microblogging behaviors,
and track the stress-buffering process in a dynamic perspective from microblogs.
