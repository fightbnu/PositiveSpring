\section{Literature review}
\subsection{Stress-buffering function of positive life events}
%3.对自杀，孤独感，压力的调节作用
Positive events have been verified as protective factors against daily stress~\citep{Ong2006Psychological,Bono2013Building}, loneliness~\citep{Chang2015Loneliness}, suicide~\citep{Evan2014Social} and depression~\citep{Santos2013The}.
The protective effect of positive events was hypothesized to operate in both directly (i.e., the more positive events people experienced, the less stress they perceived) 
and indirectly ways by \emph{'buffering'} the effect of stressors ~\citep{Cohen2010Positive,Shahar2002Positive}, 
with respect to physiological, psychological, and social coping resources ~\citep{Cohen1984Positive, Needles1990Positive}.

%1.积极事件保护的三个方面
%\citep{Folkman1997Positive,Folkman2010Stress} identified three classes of coping mechanisms that are associated with positive events during chronic stress:
%positive reappraisal, problem-focused coping, and the creation of positive events.

%4. 青少年积极事件：对身心调节作用
Due to the immature inner status and lack of experience,
adolescents exhibit more sensitive to stressors
(i.e., exams, heavy homework, isolated by classmates, family transitions),
living with frequent, long-term stress~\citep{older}. 
In this situation, 
positive events could help reinforce adolescents' sense of well-being~\citep{Coolidge2009A},
restore the capacity for dealing with stress~\citep{Doyle2003Positive},
and also have been linked to medical benefits, such as improving mood, serum cortisol levels, and lower levels of inflammation and hyper coagulability \citep{Jain2010Effects,Caputo1998Influence}.
The present study will be based on the consensus conclusions from the above studies 
that positive events could conduct stress-buffering effect on stressed adolescents.

\subsection{Assessing the stress-buffering effect of positive events}
To assess the stress-buffering effect of positive events, 
scholars have conducted many studies based on self-support methods, 
including Hassles and Uplifts Scales~\citep{Kanner1981Comparison}, 
Interpretation of Positive Events Scale~\citep{Alden2008Social}, 
Perceived Benefit Scales~\citep{Mcmillen1998The}, 
Adolescent Self-Rating Life Events Checklist~\citep{Jun2008Influence}.
For example, 
\citep{Mcmillen1998The} proposed the \emph{Perceived Benefit Scales} as a new measure of self-reported positive life changes after traumatic stressors (i.e., lifestyle changes, family closeness, community closeness). 
\citep{Jun2008Influence} investigated 282 college students using the \emph{Adolescent Self-Rating Life Events Checklist}, 
and found that the training of positive coping style is of great benefit to improve the mental health of students. 
However, the above explorations based on self-report investigations 
are difficult to exclude interference from external factors (i.e., social appreciation, pressure from measurement scenarios). 
Meanwhile, due to the lack of manpower and effective scientific methods, 
most scholars relies on a limited number of measurements, 
thus continuous measurements of stress-buffering process was difficult to carry out. 

\subsection{Measures and stress analysis based on social network}
As billions of adolescents are recording their life, share multi-media content, and communicate with friends through social networks (e.g., Tencent Microblog, Twitter, Facebook),
researchers explored to apply psychological theories into social network based stress mining from the self-expressed public data source.
Multiple content and user behavioral measures in social networks have been proven effective in user mental state analysis.
Xue \emph{et al.} \cite{Xue2014Detecting} proposed to detect adolescent stress from single microblog utilizing machine learning methods by extracting stressful topic words, abnormal posting time, and interactions with friends.
Lin \emph{et al.} \cite{Lin2014User} construct a deep neural network to combine the high-dimensional picture semantic information into stress detecting.
Based on the stress detecting result,
Li \emph{et al.} \cite{Li2015Predicting}adopted a series of multi-variant time series prediction techniques (i.e., Candlestick Charts, fuzzy Candlestick line and  SVARIMA model) to predict the future stress trend and wave.
Taking the linguistic information into consideration,
Li \emph{et al.} \cite{Li2017Exploring} employed a NARX neural network to predict a teen's future stress level referred to the impact of co-experiencing stressor events of similar companions.
To find the source of teens' stress, previous work \cite{Li2017Analyzing} developed a frame work to extract stressor events from post content and filter out stressful intervals based on teens' stressful posting rate.
Previous scholars focused on stress analysis,
while measures depicting stress-buffering and positive event lack of sufficient verification.

\subsection{Current study}
%!!!!! current: positive和stress达成了一致的认同：但是都是self-report; 
%!!!!!! 本文想通过大数据来..., 并做出方法上的创新，理论上的扩展，实践上的探索。
Given the limitations in the existing literature,
this study proposes a complete solution to test
the relationship between stress-buffering characteristics of positive events
and adolescents' microblogging behaviors in three groups of measures under hypothesis H1,
and further automatically track the dynamic process of stress-buffering under hypothesis H2:
\vspace{-0.3 cm}
\paragraph{\textbf{H1}} The stress-buffering function of positive events is correlated with
a)posting behavior, b)stress intensity and c)microblog linguistic expressions.
\vspace{-0.3 cm}
\paragraph{\textbf{H2}} Positive events cause monotonous stress changes in two cases: a) slowing down the increase of stress at the beginning,
and b) promoting the reduction of stress after stressful events.

In response to the theoretical hypothesis,
we propose new measurement methods in a non-invasion way based on social network data.
Two research questions are proposed:
\vspace{-0.3 cm}
\paragraph{\textbf{RQ1}}
How to (a) automatically sense the positive events experienced by adolescents in a timely manner,
and (b) identify the time interval impacted by a particular positive event.
\vspace{-0.3 cm}
\paragraph{\textbf{RQ2}}
How to quantify the stress-buffering effect of positive events based on above microblogging characteristics?

To answer above questions,
a pilot study is firstly conducted on the microblog dataset of 500 high school students associated with the school's scheduled positive and stressor event list.
After observing the posting behaviours and contents of stressed students under the influence of positive events,
several hypothesis are conducted to guide the next step research.
In study 1,
we test the relationship between the stress-buffering effects of automatically extracted positive events and student's microblogging characteristics.
A Chinese linguistic parser model is applied to extract structural positive events from microblogging content based on a six-dimensional positive event scale and LIWC lexicons.
We depict a students's stressful behaviours in three groups of measures (stress intensity, posting behaviour, linguistic),
and model the stress-buffering effect as the statistical difference in two comparative situations.
In study 2,
we track the dynamic process of stress-buffering function,
and quantify the stress-buffering impact of positive events in temporal order.
