\begin{abstract}
Mental health problems caused by psychological stress have become a huge obstacle to the healthy development of adolescents.
Exploring effective stress mitigation methods is the top priority to solve this problem. 
This article gives a deep inside into the stress-buffering function of positive events through microblogs posted by high school students.
Specifically, 
we first validated the hypothesis that positive events can alleviate psychological stress of adolescents. 
Further, a complete solution was proposed to: 1) automatically analyze the stress-buffering effects of positive events on different adolescents through microblogs, 
and 2) predict future stress changes under the mitigation of positive events. 
Our exploration provides guidance for school and parents that which kind of positive events could help relieve adolescent' stress in both stress prevention and stress early stopping situations.

\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{Stress} Life is always full of ups and downs.
The serious mental health problems caused by stress has become hot issues that are widely concerned around the world.
According to the newest report of American Psychological Association,
the youngest adults are most likely of all generations to report poor mental health in America,
and 91 percent of Gen-Zs between ages 18 and 21 say they have experienced physical or emotional symptom due to stress in the past month compared to 74 percent of adults overall \citep{APA2018}.
Accumulated stress comes from daily hassles, major stressful events and environmental stressors could drain adolescents' inner resources,
leading to psychological maladjustment, ranging from depression to suicidal behaviours \citep{Nock2008Suicide}.
Nowadays more than 30 million Chinese teenagers are suffering from psychological stress,
and nearly 30\% of them have a risk of depression \citep{ChinaTeen2019}.

\paragraph{Stress-buffering}
Stress-buffering is an essential process in human's stress coping system \citep{Susan1984Stress} to help get out of overwhelmed status.
%2.1心理压力缓解的概念
Psychology studies have shown that stress-buffering could function through various ways,
including exercise, self-esteem, changing environments, chatting with friends,
writing diaries and so on [xx1]. 
Positive events are considered an important way to buffer stress, 
while the mitigation mechanisms for positive events are complex and remain to be further explored [xx2]. 
%2.2 人们探求缓解心理压力的多种途径
%2.3 积极事件是缓解压力的重要途经，但是具体的缓解模式仍有待探索。

With the epidemic of social media among adolescents,
it provides a new channel for timely and non-invasive exploration of users' mental health status.
%3.随着社交媒体大数据兴起，为探索用户心理健康状态提供了及时/非侵入的新途径。
Previous studies have shown that it is feasible and reliable to detect user's psychological stress and stressor events,
and predict future psychological stress trends through social network data.
%4.前期研究表明，通过社交网络数据，可以检测心理压力，压力源事件，预测未来心理压力趋势等，是可行的，可靠的。
However, research on stress-buffering effects of uplift events from social networks still calls for more exploration.
%5.但是对于积极事件的研究还远远不够
This article will explore the restoring impact of uplift events from microblogs,
help scheduling positive interventions, and predict future stress.
%6.对于积极事件的探索，亟需展开，从而为及时安排心理压力干预，准确预测心理压力的未来发展趋势提供必要信息。
